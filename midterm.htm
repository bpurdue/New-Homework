					<h2>Variables</h2>
					<p>Create variables to contain the following. Initialize the variables with sample data. Use the most appropriate data type.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The name of this course</li>
						<li>Number of days in March</li>
						<li>Do you know JavaScript?</li>
						<li>A list of the best restaurants in Rockville</li>
						<li>Expected annual salary of a Web developer</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Math</h2>
					<p>Write the following math operations using JavaScript. Do not hard-code the result. Send the results to the console.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The price of a $20 drink plus 25% sales tax</li>
						<li>The cost of a $400 smartphone after a 15% discount</li>
						<li>The cost of four $5 sub sandwiches</li>
						<li>The cost of a $75 dinner split evenly among 5 people</li>
						<li>0.1 multiplied by 0.2. Bonus: Round the result to two decimal places.</li>
					</ol>

			<article class="span4">

					<h2>Conditional logic</h2>
					<p>Write the following either as a <code>switch</code> statement or combination of <code>if/else</code> blocks.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If your editor is “Eclipse” then send “Java developer” to the console.</li>
						<li>If your editor is “Aptana Studio” then send “Web developer” to the console.</li>
						<li>If your editor is “Sublime Text” then send “I am awesome” to the console.</li>
						<li>If your editor is “Notepad” then send “Wrong editor” to the console.</li>

					<h2>Loops</h2>
					<p>Write a loop that iterates the numbers from 5 to 15. You can write this as a <code>for</code> or a <code>while</code> loop. Each loop iteration should send the value of <code>i</code> to the console.</p>
				</section>
			</article>
			<article class="span4">
				<section>
					<h2>Functions</h2>
					<p>Write a function <code>average</code> that takes three arguments: <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code>, <code>num3</code>. The function will return (i.e. do not use console.log) the average of the three arguments. To get the average you will add them together and divide the total by three.</p>
					<p>Bonus: Write code that ensures all three arguments are of type <em>number</em>. If any of the three are not numbers have the function return <code>NaN</code> (NaN is a reserved value in JavaScript, so don't put it inside single quotes).</p>

	<script>
		// Problem 1
		var courseName = 'JavaScript';
		var daysInMarch = 31;
		var knowJavaScript = true;
		var bestRestaurantsRockville = [
			'Ihop',
			//JG: Ledo's is so yummy!
			'Ledo Pizza',
			'Mosaic Cafe',
		];
		//JG: The comma below was throwing a syntax error
		var webSalary = 50000;
		//or
		
		//JG: the "var" keyword is only needed once. Between the two examples, the number 
		// is the preferred type since numbers allow you to do arithmetic. For example, if 
		// you have multiple salaries and you want to see which one is the largest, the 
		// number type would be best suited for that.
		webSalary = '$50,000';
		
		// Problem 2
		var drinkPrice = 20 * 1.25;
		//JG: You can also write the formula below for phonePrice. It keeps you from
		// having to repeat 400 twice.
		// 400 * 0.85
		var phonePrice = 400 - (0.15 * 400);
		var costFourSandwiches = 4 * 5;
		var dinnerCostSplit = 75 / 5;
		var multiplicationProblem = 0.1 * 0.2;
		console.log(drinkPrice, phonePrice, costFourSandwiches, dinnerCostSplit, multiplicationProblem)
		
		// Problem 3
		//JG: I introduced line breaks to help with readability.

		// var editor1 = 'Eclipse';
		// var editor2 = 'Aptana Studio';
		// var editor3 = 'Sublime Text';
		// var editor4 = 'Notepad';

		function editorResponse(editor) {
			if (editor === 'Eclipse') {
				return 'Java developer';
			}

			if (editor === 'Aptana Studio') {
				return 'Web developer';
			}

			if (editor === 'Sublime Text') {
				return 'I am awesome';
			}

			if (editor === 'Notepad') {
				return 'Wrong editor';
			}
		}

		console.log(editorResponse('Eclipse'));
		console.log(editorResponse('Aptana Studio'));
		console.log(editorResponse('Sublime Text'));
		console.log(editorResponse('Notepad'));
		
		// Problem 4
		//JG: I removed the "= 1" assignment since it gets overwritten in the loop anyway
		var i;

		for (i = 5; i <= 15; i += 1) {
			// i += 1;
			//JG: Just making sure each loop iteration sends "i" to the console
			console.log(i);
		}

		// console.log(i);




		// Problem 5
		function average(num1, num2, num3) {
			return (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;
		}
		
		
		// Problem 6
		//JG: I wrapped the statement below in a comment to keep it from throwing an error
		// You mean there is an easy part?

		//JG: I think you're doing great! The code you turned in for the mid-term works.
		// I think Problem 3 was the one that tripped you up the most.
		// For now I think you have a pretty good grasp of the basics. Programming in 
		// general has a steep learning curve. JavaScript is unique in some of its features,
		// but the logic part is what gets most people.
